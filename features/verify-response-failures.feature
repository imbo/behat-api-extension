                Scenario: Make request
                    Given the request body is:
                        '''
                        response body
                        '''
                    When I request "/echo"
                    Then the response body matches:
                        '''
                        /foobar/
                        '''
            """
        When I run "behat features/assert-response-body-matches.feature"
        Then it should fail with:
            """
            Expected response body to match regular expression "/foobar/", got "response body". (Imbo\BehatApiExtension\Exception\AssertionFailedException)
            """
